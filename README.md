# ARG Framework

With a series of ready-to-use solutions, this project is an independent solution from the one offered by the creat-react-app command, in addition, you can extend this solution depending on the needs of your project. This solution is integrated with express therefore you can develop your own server side render, at the moment it has not been integrated as SSR.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started 

Install the framework as following:

### `npm install --save-dev arg_framework`

When your project will be ready you will run the following:

- `npm start`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`

So far, the application runs only in development mode using the devserver\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
