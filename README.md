# ARG Framework

Ready-to-use environment to develop react applications, this project is similar to *creat-react-app* but independent from it, besides, you can extend this solution depending on the needs of your project. This solution is integrated with express, therefore, you can develop your own server side render, at the moment SSR is not supported by default, even though, it's easy to integrate with a custom server router or with any other third part like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

## üöÄ Getting Started 

Install the framework as following:

### `npm install --save-dev arg_framework`

When your project will be ready you will run the following:

- `npm start`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`

So far, the application runs only in development mode using the devserver\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## üìò About the Project

In the src folder there are templates to begin creating your application including a isolated folder for testing to mantain the quality of your code.

## üòÉ REACT Template

This is a template that uses the arg framework ([here](https://github.com/rod6214/react_template)).
